## `functionName : type -> signature`

<!-- Add suggested documentation here, including some examples with doctests. -->


### Motivating use case 

<!-- Why are you proposing this function? In what specific situation did it come in handy? -->

### Rationale

<!-- If this function didn't exist in this library, what would users need to do? Generally speaking if the function you are proposing is an existing function with some minor change (like arguments flipped or a single literal argument pre-applied), you should make a strong argument about the increase in readability or convenience this is going to bring. If it's a more involved function, make an argument about  how it can be widely applicable and not just specific to one use case. -->
