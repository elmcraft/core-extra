{-| Library for building comparison functions.

This library makes it easy to create comparison functions for arbitary types by composing
smaller comparison functions. For instance, suppose you are defining a data type to represent
a standard deck of cards. You might define it as:

    type alias Card =
        { value : Value, suite : Suite }

    type Suite
        = Clubs
        | Hearts
        | Diamonds
        | Spades

    type Value
        = Two
        | Three
        | Four
        | Five
        | Six
        | Seven
        | Eight
        | Nine
        | Ten
        | Jack
        | Queen
        | King
        | Ace

With this representation, you could define an ordering for `Card` values compositionally:

    import Order.Extra

    cardOrdering : Card -> Card -> Order
    cardOrdering =
        Ordering.byFieldWith suiteOrdering .suite
            |> Ordering.breakTiesWith
                (Ordering.byFieldWith valueOrdering .value)

    suiteOrdering : Suite -> Suite -> Order
    suiteOrdering =
        Ordering.explicit [ Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades ]

    valueOrdering : Value -> Value -> Order
    valueOrdering =
        Ordering.explicit
            [ Two
            , Three
            , Four
            , Five
            , Six
            , Seven
            , Eight
            , Nine
            , Ten
            , Jack
            , Queen
            , King
            , Ace
            ]

You can then use this ordering to sort cards, make comparisons, and so on. For instance,
to sort a deck of cards you can use `cardOrdering` directly:

    sortCards : List Card -> List Card
    sortCards =
        List.sortWith cardOrdering

{-| Produces an ordering defined by an explicit ranking function combined with a
secondary ordering function to compare elements within the same rank. The rule is
that all items are sorted first by rank, and then using the given within-rank
ordering for items of the same rank.

This function is intended for use with types that have multiple cases where
constructors for some or all of the cases take arguments. (Otherwise use `Ordering.explicit`
instead which has a simpler interface.) For instance, to make an ordering for
a type such as:

    type JokerCard
        = NormalCard Value Suite
        | Joker

you could use `byRank` to sort all the normal cards before the jokers like so:

    jokerCardOrdering : JokerCard -> JokerCard -> Order
    jokerCardOrdering =
        Order.Extra.byRank
            (\card ->
                case card of
                    NormalCard _ _ ->
                        1

                    Joker ->
                        2
            )
            (\x y ->
                case ( x, y ) of
                    ( NormalCard v1 s1, NormalCard v2 s2 ) ->
                        suiteOrdering s1 s2
                            |> Order.Extra.ifStillTiedThen
                                (valueOrdering v1 v2)

                    _ ->
                        EQ
            )

More generally, the expected pattern is that for each case in your type, you assign
that case to a unique rank with the ranking function. Then for your within-rank
ordering, you have a case statement that enumerates all the "tie" states and
specifies how to break ties, and then uses a catch-all case that returns
`Ordering.noConflicts` to specify that all remaining cases cannot give rise to
the need to do any subcomparisons. (This can be either because the values being
compared have no internal structure and so are always equal, or because they are
constructors with different ranks and so will never be compared by this function.)

byRank rank withinRankOrdering =
    byField rank |> breakTiesWith withinRankOrdering


{-| Returns the main order unless it is `EQ`, in which case returns the tiebreaker.

This function does for `Order`s what `breakTiesWith` does for `Ordering`s. It is
useful in cases where you want to perform a cascading comparison of multiple pairs
of values that are not wrapped in a container value, as happens when examining the
individual fields of a constructor.
